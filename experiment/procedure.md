# Procedure

1. Fix the delta wing-sting balance assembly in the wind tunnel with apex facing the flow and ensure Î± = 0<sup>o</sup> with a digital protractor. 

2. Connect the wires of sting balance to the daq system.

3. Connect the pressure ports in the settling chamber and the test section of the wind tunnel to the pressure measurement instrument to measure the freestream velocity.

4. Zero calibrate the daq for both pressure measurement and force measurement.

5. Record the pressure reading to estimate the freestream velocity. Set a desired velocity in the wind tunnel using VFD.

6. Record the forces and moment at different values of angle of attack with an interval of 5<sup>o</sup>.

7. The experiment can be repeated for different velocity to get readings for different Reynolds number.

8. Tabulate all the data and calculate C<sub>L</sub>, C<sub>D</sub>, and C<sub>M</sub> using the equations.

    ### Calculations

    - Using eq. (1-3) determine the Coefficient of different forces and moment, may call it as experimental value.

9. Plot graph for coefficients for different values of angle of attack and compare them with the experimental estimates from the literature.
